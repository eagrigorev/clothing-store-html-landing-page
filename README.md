# clothing-store-landing-page

I decided to go further with the previous multi-page clothing store project and updated it with the help of a curator. I added a few new things for that demo: a product search filter, a custom cart, Vue.js, and Node.js implementation to add and remove goods and track user actions. I also tweaked CSS and SCSS files for better responsiveness with fewer @media iterations.

Figma template was provided by my student project curator: https://www.figma.com/file/P6G1VYCw2ppqNAiTxlWkZP/Clothing-Store-Template?node-id=0%3A1

To launch that project, you will need to install Node.js on your PC and install the following modules via NPM in your IDE:

1. express
2. fs
3. jasmine
4. moment
5. node-static
6. nodemon
7. webpack
8. webpack-cli
