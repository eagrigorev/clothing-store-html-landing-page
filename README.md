## Multi-Page Clothing Store

### Running the App

Package installation: run `npm install` from the root folder.

Server-side: `node server.js` from the `/server` folder.

### General Notes

I decided to go further with the previous [multi-page clothing store project](https://github.com/eagrigorev/clothing-store-template) and updated it. I added a few new things for that demo: a product search filter, a custom cart, Vue.js, and Node.js implementation to add and remove goods and track user actions. I also tweaked CSS and SCSS files for better responsiveness with fewer @media iterations.
