# ðŸ‘š Multi-Page Clothing Store
I decided to go further with the previous multi-page clothing store project and updated it. I added a few new things for that demo: a product search filter, a custom cart, Vue.js, and Node.js implementation to add and remove goods and track user actions. I also tweaked CSS and SCSS files for better responsiveness with fewer @media iterations. To launch that project, you will need to install Node.js on your PC and run `npm install` and `node server/server.js`.
